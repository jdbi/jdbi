* <X extends Exception> should probably generally be <X extends Throwable>
* move SerializableTransactionRunner.Config to top-level class to comply with convention
* MapMappers.MapMappers(): law of least surprise, change default to nop (update javadoc too)
* Make ColumnNameMatcher.columnNameBeginsWith abstract (non-default)
* Rename @JdbiConstructor to @JdbiCreator or @JdbiFactory
* Require @HStore annotation for HSTORE mapping / binding (remove legacy support for unqualified
  maps in Postgres plugin)
* Throwables throwOnlyException only exists because of the above <X extends Exception> issue, so clean that up too
