/**
 * Postgres version of argument factory for {@link Duration}.
 *
 * <p>
 * For simplicity, this implementation makes the duration positive before proceeding. However, this can cause an
 * {@link ArithmeticException} to be thrown. E.g., this can occur if your duration is -2^63 seconds.
 *
 * <p>
 * Not all {@link Duration}s can be represented as intervals in Postgres.
 * One incompatibility results from {@link Duration}s that are too large. This is due to (1) {@link Duration}s using
 * a {@code long} internally, and {@link PGInterval}s using {@code int}s; and (2) the conversion of days to months or
 * years being ambiguous.
 * Another results from {@link Duration}s being too precise; they have nanosecond precision, whereas Postgres has only
 * microsecond.
 * An {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown in these cases.
 * The handling of the second is subject to revision in the future; for example, it would be reasonable to have a
 * configurable truncation option.
