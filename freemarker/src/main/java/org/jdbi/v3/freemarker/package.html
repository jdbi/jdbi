<code>freemarker</code> provides advanced string template processing.
Defined attributes can be accessed in the templates via standard Freemarker
variable markers e.g. <code>${...}</code>.
Use <code>&lt;#include "someFile.ftl" &gt;</code> statements for both relative
and absolute include statements.
Only templates located with <code>FreemarkerSqlLocator</code> can have includes.
