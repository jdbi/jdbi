3.6.0
  - New API
    - ConnectionFactory now also may customize connection closing
  - New beta API
    - Type qualifiers for binding and mapping. Use annotations to distinguish between different SQL
      data types that map to the same Java type. e.g. VARCHAR, NVARCHAR, and Postgres MACADDR all
      map to String, but are bound and mapped with different JDBC APIs.
    - Support for NVARCHAR columns, using the @NVarchar qualifying annotation
    - Support for Postgres MACADDR columns, using the @MacAddr qualifying annotation.
    - Support for HSTORE columns, using the @HStore annotation

3.5.2
  - Bug Fixes
    - bindList throws an NPE if called with an immutable list,
      method is safe according to the specification
  - Improvements
    - improve binding private implementations of interfaces
    - improved loggability (through SqlLogger) of JDBI's built-in Argument instances

3.5.1 (whoops, 3.5.0 was released from the wrong commit!)
  - New API
    - SqlStatements.allowUnusedBindings allows you to bind Arguments to query parts that may be
      left out of the final query (e.g. by a TemplateEngine that renders conditional blocks)
      without getting an Exception.
    - Added the MapMappers JdbiConfig class to configure column name case changes, preferred over
      the old boolean toggle.
    - ColumnNameMatcher.columnNameStartsWith() method, used by reflection mappers to short-circuit
      nested mappings when no columns start with the nested prefix.
    - bindMethodsList and @BindMethodsList create VALUES(...) tuples by calling named methods
  - Improvements
    - SqlObject no longer transforms non-Runtime exceptions (slightly breaking change)
    - Use MethodHandles over Reflection to additionally do less exception wrapping / transformation
    - Skip unused string formatting for performance
    - Spring FactoryBean better singleton support
    - KotlinMapper respects constructor annotations, lateinit improvements
    - Behavioral fixes in Argument binding where the number of provided Arguments differs from the
      expected number.
    - Optional mapping of @Nested objects when using BeanMapper, ConstructorMapper, FieldMapper, or
      KotlinMapper. @Nested objects are only mapped when the result set contains columns that match
      the nested object.
    - ConstructorMapper allows constructor parameters annotated @Nullable to be missing from the
      result set. Any annotation named "Nullable" from any package may be used.
    - jdbi3-testing artifact has pg dependencies marked as optional, in case you e.g. only want h2
      or oracle
    - LocalTransactionHandler: rollback on thrown Throwable
    - test on openjdk11
    - EnumSet mapping support

3.4.0
    [ NOTE: this release's git tags are missing due to maintainer error! ]
  - New API

    - SqlStatements.setQueryTimeout(int) to configure the JDBC Statement queryTimeout.
  - Bug Fixes
    - Bridge methods cause SqlObject exceptions to get wrapped in `InvocationTargetException`
    - Ignore static methods on SqlObject types
  - Improvements

      registered to observe transaction success and failure.
    - JdbiRule.migrateWithFlyway() chaining method to run Flyway migrations on the test database
      prior to running tests.
    - @UseStringSubstitutorTemplateEngine SQL object annotation.
    - @Beta annotation to identify non-final APIs.
      - Application developers are invited to try out beta APIs and provide feedback to help us
        identify weaknesses and make improvements before new APIs are made final.
      - Library maintainers are discouraged from using beta APIs, as this might lead to
        ClassNotFoundExceptions or NoSuchMethodExceptions at runtime whenever beta APIs change.
  - Improvements
    - Added some extra javadoc to SqlLogger
    - @UseTemplateEngine now works with MessageFormatTemplateEngine and
      StringSubstitutorTemplateEngine
  - Bug fixes
    - SqlStatement.bindMethods() (and @BindMethods) now selects the correct method when the method
      return type is generic.
    - mapToMap() no longer throws an exception on empty resultsets when
      ResultProducers.allowNoResults is true
  - Breaking changes
    - Remove JdbiRule.createJdbi() in favor of createDataSource(). This was necessary to facilitate
      the migrateWithFlyway() feature above, and pave the way for future additions.
    - Remove SqlLogger.wrap() added in 3.2.0 from public API.
    - Convert MessageFormatTemplateEngine from an enum to a plain class with a public constructor.
      The INSTANCE enum constant has been likewise removed.

    - jdbi3-sqlite - plugin for use with SQLite database
  - New API
    - @SqlScript annotation to execute multiple statements
    - SqlLogger for logging queries, timing, and exceptions. Replacing TimingCollector, which
      is now deprecated

  - Improvements
    - @MaxRows.value() may now be omitted when used as a parameter annotation
    - SerializableTransactionRunner 'max retries' handling throws more meaningful exceptions
    - Postgres operators like '?' and '?|' may now be used without being mistaken for a positional
      parameter. Escape them in your SQL statements as '??' and '??|', respectively.
    - Support for binding OptionalInt, OptionalLong, and OptionalDouble parameters.
  - Bug fixes:
    - SqlObject default methods now work in JDK 9
    - SqlObject no longer gets confused about result types due to bridge methods
    - StringTemplate no longer shares template groups across threads, to work around concurrency
      issues in StringTemplate project

      on unmatched "<" when you really meant "less than!"
    - LocalDate binding should store the correct date when the server and database are running
      in different time zones.

3.1.1
  - Improve IBM JDK compatibility with default methods
  - Allow non-public SqlObject types!!!
  - Fix some ThreadLocal and StringTemplate leaks

3.1.0
  - The strict transaction handling check in Handle.close() may be disabled via
    getConfig(Handles.class).setForceEndTransactions(false).
  - StringTemplate SQL locator supports StringTemplate groups importing from other groups.
  - New RowReducer interface and related APIs make it simple to reduce master-detail joins
    into a series of master objects with the detail objects attached. See:
    - RowReducer interface
    - LinkedHashMapRowReducer abstract implementation for 90% of cases
    - ResultBearing.reduceRows(RowReducer)
    - @UseRowReducer SQL Object annotation
  - Fixed bug in PreparedBatch preventing batches from being reusable.
  - Additional Kotlin convenience methods to avoid adding ".java" on every Kotlin type:
    - Jdbi.withExtension(KClass, ExtensionCallback)
    - Jdbi.useExtension(KClass, ExtensionConsumer)
    - Jdbi.withExtensionUnchecked(KClass, callback)
    - Jdbi.useExtensionUnchecked(KClass, callback)
  - EnumMapper tries a case insensitive match if there's no exact match
  - OracleReturning.returningDml() supports named parameters
  - Fixed regression in Postgres typed enum mapper, which caused a fallback on the
    Jdbi default enum mapper.

3.0.1
  - Kotlin mapper support for @Nested annotation
  - ReflectionMapperUtil utility class made public.
  - collectInto() and SQL Object return type support for OptionalInt, OptionalLong,
    and OptionalDouble, and Vavr Option.
  - New jdbi3-sqlite plugin with SQLite-specific binding and column mapping for java.net.URL.
  - Workaround for multithreaded race condition loading StringTemplate STGroups and templates.
  - Column mapper for Vavr Option.

3.0.0
  - [breaking] Added ConfigRegistry parameter to SqlLocator.locate() method.

3.0.0-rc2
  - Row and column mapper for Optional types
  - Binding of nested attributes e.g. ":user.address.city" with bindBean(), bindMethods(),
    bindFields(), as well as @BindBean, @BindMethods, and @BindFields in SQL objects.
  - Mapping of nested attributes with BeanMapper, ConstructorMapper, and FieldMapper, using
    the @Nested annotation.
  - SQL Objects inherit class annotations from supertypes.
  - bindList() and @BindList now follow the parameter naming style of the active SqlParser,
    via the new SqlParser.nameParameter() method. e.g. ":foo" for ColonPrefixSqlParser, vs
    "#foo" for HashPrefixSqlParser.

3.0.0-rc1
  - SQL Object methods may have a Consumer<T> instead of a return type. See
    http://jdbi.github.io/#_consumer_methods.

3.0.0-beta4
  - [breaking] ResultSetMapper -> ResultSetScanner; reducing overloaded 'Mapper'
  - PreparedBatch: throw an exception if you try to add() an empty binding
  - [breaking] Removed column mapper fallback behavior from
    StatementContext.findRowMapperFor() and RowMappers.findFor(), in favor or new
    StatementContext.findMapperFor() and Mappers.findFor() methods. Previously,
    findRowMapperFor() would first consult the RowMappers registry, then the
    ColumnMappers registry if no RowMapper was registered for a given type. Thus:
    - StatementContext.findMapperFor(...) or Mappers.findFor() may return a row mapper or
      a first-column mapper.
    - StatementContext.findRowMapperFor(...) or RowMappers.findFor() returns only row
      mappers
    - StatementContext.findColumnMapperFor(...) or ColumnMappers.findFor() returns only
      column mapper
  - [breaking] Renamed @SqlMethodAnnotation meta-annotation to @SqlOperation.
  - Added support for Vavr object-functional data types in jdbi3-vavr module.

    withExtensionUnchecked, useExtensionUnchecked.
  - Renamed org.jdbi:jdbi3 artifact to org.jdbi:jdbi3-core, for consistency with
    other modules.
  - [breaking] StatementContext.getParsedSql() now returns a ParsedSql instead of String
  - [breaking] Remove SqlStatement fetchForward / Reverse ; statements now FORWARD_ONLY

3.0.0-beta2
  - [breaking] Removed Handle.update() and Handle.insert(), in favor of
    Handle.execute(), which does the same thing. Handle.execute() now returns
    the update count.
  - Removed core dependency on Guava.
  - [breaking] Switch from 1- to 0-based indices in OracleReturning.returnParameters()
  - [breaking] Added StatementContext parameter to NamedArgumentFinder.find() method

  - [breaking] Modified @Register* annotations to be repeatable, instead of using
    array attributes.
  - [breaking] Moved and renamed MapEntryMapper.Config to top-level class
    MapEntryMappers
  - MapMapper preserves column ordering, #848
  - [breaking] split Handle.cleanupHandle() into cleanupHandleCommit() and *Rollback()
  - [breaking] remove TransactionStatus enum
  - [breaking] Refactored StatementRewriter into TemplateEngine and SqlParser.

3.0.0-beta1
  - [breaking] Refactored SqlStatementCustomizerFactory.createForParameter(...)
    - Now returns new SqlStatementParameterCustomizer type, so parameter customizers
      can be cached and reused for performance.
    - Now accepts a `Type` parameter, so parameter binders no longer have to check
      whether the statement is a PreparedBatch.
  - [breaking] Handlers config class, refactored HandlerFactory permit alternative
    method handler mapping strategies.
  - [breaking] Renamed BeanMapper, FieldMapper, and ConstructorMapper's `of(...)`
    methods to `factory(...)`. Added `of` methods in their place which return
    RowMappers, whereas the `factory` methods from before return `RowMapperFactory`s.
  - [breaking] Mixing named and positional parameters in SQL statements will now
    throw an exception. See https://github.com/jdbi/jdbi/pull/787
  - Handlers registry allows users to use custom SQL Object method handlers
    without a SQL method annotation.
  - HandlerDecorators registry allows adding custom behavior to any SQL Object
    method, with or without an annotation.
  - jdbi3-kotlin plugin adds support for mapping Kotlin data classes.
  - jdbi3-kotlin-sqlobject plugin adds support for Kotlin SQL Objects,
    including Kotlin default methods, and default parameter values.
  - Support for collecting results into Map, and Guava's Multimap.
  - Configuration option to control how "untyped null" arguments are bound.
    Useful for some database vendors (e.g. Derby, Sybase) that expect a different
    SQL type constant for null values.
  - Support boolean[] return type from @SqlBatch methods
  - Bug fixes:
    - NullPointerException in Postgres plugin when binding null UUID
    - IllegalArgumentException with @SqlBatch when the batch is empty

  - Plugins to support types from 3rd party libraries: JodaTime, Guava,
    StringTemplate, Spring
  - Plugins to support specific database vendors: H2, Oracle, Postgres
  - Migration-friendly: Jdbi v2 and v3 will happily coexist within the same
    project, so you can migrate at your own pace.

    Change Handle#script to batch the statements in the script

1.2.4
    Bug fix in named parameter handling with quotes (would ignore some named params incorrectly)

1.2.3
    Allow configuring transaction handlers in properties

    Allow configuring of externalized sql locating (ie, non-classpath)

1.2.2
    Add callback based transaction handling in order to cleanly support the various
    transactional contexts (CMT, BMT, Spring, Local) etc.

1.2.1
    Via the Spring DBIBean, IDBI#open(HandleCallback) now uses the transactionally bound handle
    if there is one.

1.2.0
    DBIException now extends RuntimeException. The 7 character change major release =)

    Added DBIUtils.closeHandleIfNecessary(Handle, IDBI) to allow for transparently managing
    transactions and connections in Spring whteher tx's are enabled or not.

1.1.2
    Handle#query(String, RowCallback): void no longer starts a transaction
    automagically

1.1.1
    Support full-line comments in external sql and sql scripts. Full line comments
    must begin with # or // or -- as the first character(s) on the line.

1.1.0
    Added handle#first(..): Map convenience functions to query for individual rows

    Removed DBITransactionFailedException and used plain old DBIException
    in its place

    Added unstable package for holding elements subject to API changes
    during a major release cycle.

    Handle decorator functionality added to unstable feature set

    JavaBean mapped named parameter support

    Renamed Handle#preparedBatch to Handle#prepareBatch

    Queries return java.util.List instead of java.util.Collection

    Much more sophisticated auto-configuration

    Broke backwards compatibility on handle.query(String, Object) method behavior
        (this is reason why 1.1.0 version increment)
        (read the javadocs if you use this method)

    Removed method Handle#query(String, Object, Object)
        Could lea to confusion with changed behavior mentioned above

1.0.10
    Batch and PreparedBatch Support

    Removed an unused exception

    Fixed bug in named parameter extractor (would miss named params not preceeded by whitespace)

1.0.9
    Better auto-detection of statement type (named, raw sql, etc)

1.0.8
    Spring integration tools

1.0.7
    Provide an interface for the DBI class in order to play nicer with proxies

1.0.6
    Prepared statement re-use was failing on Oracle, fixed.

1.0.5
    Fleshed out the execute(..) methods to take full array of arguments, like
    query.

    Added update(..): int which return number of rows affected

    Lots of internal refactoring

1.0.4
    Was swallowing an exception in one place for the (brief) 1.0.3 release.
    Definately upgrade if using 1.0.3

1.0.3
    Fixed a bug where quoted text could be interpreted as named tokens, bad me.

    Added HandleCallback methods to DBI to manage handle db resources etc for
    clients.

    Removed test dependency on Jakarta commons-io, which had been used, previously,
    for deleting the test database. Tests now depend only on derby and junit, still
    with no runtime dependencies (other than the JDBC driver for your database).

1.0.2
    Added facility for loading connection info from properties file
    for convenience. Totally optional, thankfully.

1.0.1
    Added overloaded argument signatures to callback-based queries

1.0
    Initial Release
