1.2.2
    Add callback based transaction handling in order to cleanly support the various
    transactional contexts (CMT, BMT, Spring, Local) etc.

1.2.1
    Via the Spring DBIBean, IDBI#open(HandleCallback) now uses the transactionally bound handle
    if there is one.

1.2.0
    DBIException now extends RuntimeException. The 7 character change major release =)

    Added DBIUtils.closeHandleIfNecessary(Handle, IDBI) to allow for transparently managing
    transactions and connections in Spring whteher tx's are enabled or not.

1.1.2
    Handle#query(String, RowCallback): void no longer starts a transaction
    automagically

1.1.1

    during a major release cycle.

    Handle decorator functionality added to unstable feature set

    JavaBean mapped named parameter support

    Renamed Handle#preparedBatch to Handle#prepareBatch

    Queries return java.util.List instead of java.util.Collection

    Much more sophisticated auto-configuration

    Broke backwards compatibility on handle.query(String, Object) method behavior
        (this is reason why 1.1.0 version increment)
        (read the javadocs if you use this method)

    Removed method Handle#query(String, Object, Object)
        Could lea to confusion with changed behavior mentioned above

1.0.10
    Batch and PreparedBatch Support

    Removed an unused exception

1.0.8
    Spring integration tools

1.0.7
    Provide an interface for the DBI class in order to play nicer with proxies

1.0.6
    Prepared statement re-use was failing on Oracle, fixed.

1.0.5
    Fleshed out the execute(..) methods to take full array of arguments, like
    query.

    Added update(..): int which return number of rows affected

    Lots of internal refactoring

1.0.4
    Was swallowing an exception in one place for the (brief) 1.0.3 release.
    Definately upgrade if using 1.0.3

1.0.3
    Fixed a bug where quoted text could be interpreted as named tokens, bad me.

    Added HandleCallback methods to DBI to manage handle db resources etc for
    clients.

    Removed test dependency on Jakarta commons-io, which had been used, previously,
    for deleting the test database. Tests now depend only on derby and junit, still
    with no runtime dependencies (other than the JDBC driver for your database).

1.0.2
    Added facility for loading connection info from properties file
    for convenience. Totally optional, thankfully.

1.0.1
    Added overloaded argument signatures to callback-based queries

1.0
    Initial Release
