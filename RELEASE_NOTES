2.73
  - Allow clearing of bindings in SQLStatement
  - (finally!) parse Postgres CAST syntax 'value::type' properly in colon
    prefix statements
  - fix @SqlBatch hanging if you forget to include an Iterable-like param
  - fix @SqlUpdate @GetGeneratedKeys to allow non-number return types

2.72
  - Support for the ability to provide a list of the column names returned
    in a prepared batch #254

2.71
  - fix @BindBean of private subtypes, #242

2.70 *** MAJOR CHANGES ***
  - allow JDK8 default methods in SQLObject interfaces. Backport of #190.
  - switch to standard Maven toolchains.xml for cross-compilation, #169.
    See https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html
    for instructions on how to use it.
  - Correctly handle semicolons and inline comments in SQL statements.
    Existing SQL statements may break due to lexer changes, ensure you have
    test coverage.
  - Introduce "column mappers" which dramatically improve type handling
    for BeanMapper-style automatic mapping
      see https://github.com/jdbi/jdbi/pull/164
  - Disallow "nested" transactions explicitly.  They almost certainly don't
    work the way you expect.  Use savepoints instead.
  - Eagerly check return type of @SqlUpdate annotated SqlObject methods
  - Allow getting generated keys by name for Oracle
  - Allow getting generated keys from prepared Batch statements
  - Cache StatementRewriter parsing of statements
  - Support mapping of URI, char, Character types

  - Recognize MySQL REPLACE statements

2.35
  - Use CGLIB for sql objects instead of dyanmic proxies
  - Support for classes as well as interfaces in the sql object api
  - Add @Transaction for non @Sql* methods in sql objects

2.31
  - Add access to ResultSet on FoldController

2.12
  - Registered Mappers on DBi and Handle, and the Query#mapTo addition
  - Sql Object API

2.11
  - Botched release attempt with Maven 3

2.10.2
  - Bugfix: Allow escaping of arbitrary characters in the SQL source, especially allow
            escaping of ':' (which is needed for postgres type casts)

2.10.0
  - minor code cleanups to reduce number of warnings
  - Expose NamedArgumentFinder to allow custom lookup of Arguments. JDBI already provides
    two implementations of the Interface, one for Maps and one for BeanProperties.
  - Add ability to set query timeout (in seconds) on SQLStatement

2.9.3
  - Add <url /> element to pom so can get into central :-)

2.9.2

  - First 2.9 series release

2.9.0
  - Make the DefaultMapper public.
  - Aborted, trying to make gpg signing work correctly

2.8.0
  - Add methods to SQLStatement and PreparedBatch that allow adding a set of defines
    to the context in one go.
  - Add ~ { and } as legal characters in the colon prefix grammar

2.7.0
  - A TimingCollector was added which can be registered on the DBI or handle which then
    gets called with nanosecond resolution elapsed time every time a statement is run
    against the data base.
  - re-added some Exception constructors that were accidentially removed in 2.3.0 making
    2.4.0-2.6.x non-backwards compatible.
  - Bind java.util.Date as a timestamp because it contains time and date.
  - BasicHandle constructor is now package private (which it always should have been)
  - add Clirr Report to the Maven Site
  - convert all calls to System.currentTimeMillis() to System.nanoTime(), which is more
    accurate and much more lightweight. As we only calculate time differences, it is
    good enough.
  - fix more compiler warnings
  - add null checks for all object types on SQLStatement
  - move object null checks, that don't require boxing/unboxing
    into the Argument classes. Keep the checks for object/primitive
    types in SQL to avoid boxing/unboxing overhead.

2.6.0
   Fix a number of compiler warnings
   Add new binding methods for SQLStatement
    - Integer, Boolean, Byte, Long, Short  Object
    - double, float, short primitive
   All bind methods taking an object should check
   for null values and bind a NullArgument accordingly.

2.5.0
    Add new binding methods for SQLStatement
      - char types
      - boolean as int (for DBs missing a boolean type)
    Re-add unit test removed in 2.4.9 with unicode escapes

2.4.9
    Remove Unit tests that fails depending on Platform Encoding

2.4.8
    Switch to ANTLR 3 for grammars so that shading works again

    Switch to maven2 for builds

    Add the statement context to statement related exceptions, including a new
    DBIExcpetion abstact subclass, StatementException, which exposes this.

2.3.0
    Fix OracleReturning compile time dependency using Reflection.
    Deprecated OracleReturning.
    Added CallableStatement support :
      - new method handle.prepareCall
      - new Call class and CallableStatementMapper interface

    Fixes to colon prefix grammar to support empty string literals and
    escaped quotes.

    Added access to more of the actual context for a statement to StatementContext

    prepared statement parameter type information.

1.4.2
    Be explicit about target jdk version (1.4) for this branch

1.4.1

    Expose the handle decorator functionality on the IDBI interface

    Add a script locator mechanism analogous to the statement locator

1.3.2
    Save SQLException to provide more information to the DBIException on

    Support for "global" named parameters at the handle and DBI levels

1.2.3
    Allow configuring transaction handlers in properties

    Allow configuring of externalized sql locating (ie, non-classpath)

1.2.2
    Add callback based transaction handling in order to cleanly support the various
    transactional contexts (CMT, BMT, Spring, Local) etc.

1.2.1
    Via the Spring DBIBean, IDBI#open(HandleCallback) now uses the transactionally bound handle
    if there is one.

1.2.0
    DBIException now extends RuntimeException. The 7 character change major release =)

    Added DBIUtils.closeHandleIfNecessary(Handle, IDBI) to allow for transparently managing
    transactions and connections in Spring whteher tx's are enabled or not.

1.1.2
    Handle#query(String, RowCallback): void no longer starts a transaction
    automagically

1.1.1
    Support full-line comments in external sql and sql scripts. Full line comments
    must begin with # or // or -- as the first character(s) on the line.

    Removed DBITransactionFailedException and used plain old DBIException
    in its place

    Added unstable package for holding elements subject to API changes
    during a major release cycle.

    Handle decorator functionality added to unstable feature set

    JavaBean mapped named parameter support

    Renamed Handle#preparedBatch to Handle#prepareBatch

    Queries return java.util.List instead of java.util.Collection

    Much more sophisticated auto-configuration

    Broke backwards compatibility on handle.query(String, Object) method behavior
        (this is reason why 1.1.0 version increment)
        (read the javadocs if you use this method)

    Removed method Handle#query(String, Object, Object)
        Could lea to confusion with changed behavior mentioned above

1.0.10
    Batch and PreparedBatch Support

    Removed an unused exception

    Fixed bug in named parameter extractor (would miss named params not preceeded by whitespace)

1.0.9
    Better auto-detection of statement type (named, raw sql, etc)

1.0.8
    Spring integration tools

1.0.7
    Provide an interface for the DBI class in order to play nicer with proxies

1.0.6
    Prepared statement re-use was failing on Oracle, fixed.

1.0.5
    Fleshed out the execute(..) methods to take full array of arguments, like
    query.

    Added update(..): int which return number of rows affected

    Lots of internal refactoring

1.0.4
    Was swallowing an exception in one place for the (brief) 1.0.3 release.
    Definately upgrade if using 1.0.3

1.0.3
    Fixed a bug where quoted text could be interpreted as named tokens, bad me.

    Added HandleCallback methods to DBI to manage handle db resources etc for
    clients.

    Removed test dependency on Jakarta commons-io, which had been used, previously,
    for deleting the test database. Tests now depend only on derby and junit, still
    with no runtime dependencies (other than the JDBC driver for your database).

1.0.2
    Added facility for loading connection info from properties file
    for convenience. Totally optional, thankfully.

1.0.1
    Added overloaded argument signatures to callback-based queries

1.0
    Initial Release
