3.0.0-beta2-SNAPSHOT (in progress)
  - [breaking] Removed Handle.update() and Handle.insert(), in favor of
    Handle.execute(), which does the same thing. Handle.execute() now returns
    the update count.
  - Removed core dependency on Guava.
  - [breaking] Switch from 1- to 0-based indices in OracleReturning.returnParameters()
  - [breaking] Added StatementContext parameter to NamedArgumentFinder.find() method
  - [breaking] Moved JoinRowMapper.JoinRow class to top-level class
  - [breaking] Modified @Register* annotations to be repeatable, instead of using
    array attributes.
  - [breaking] Moved and renamed MapEntryMapper.Config to top-level class
    MapEntryMappers
  - MapMapper preserves column ordering, #848
  - array binder now guesses type based on first element of untyped collections, rather than passing

3.0.0-beta1
  - [breaking] Refactored SqlStatementCustomizerFactory.createForParameter(...)
    - Now returns new SqlStatementParameterCustomizer type, so parameter customizers
      can be cached and reused for performance.
    - Now accepts a `Type` parameter, so parameter binders no longer have to check
      whether the statement is a PreparedBatch.
  - [breaking] Handlers config class, refactored HandlerFactory permit alternative
    method handler mapping strategies.
  - [breaking] Renamed BeanMapper, FieldMapper, and ConstructorMapper's `of(...)`
    methods to `factory(...)`. Added `of` methods in their place which return
    RowMappers, whereas the `factory` methods from before return `RowMapperFactory`s.
  - [breaking] Mixing named and positional parameters in SQL statements will now
    throw an exception. See https://github.com/jdbi/jdbi/pull/787
  - Handlers registry allows users to use custom SQL Object method handlers
    without a SQL method annotation.
  - HandlerDecorators registry allows adding custom behavior to any SQL Object
    method, with or without an annotation.
  - jdbi3-kotlin plugin adds support for mapping Kotlin data classes.
  - jdbi3-kotlin-sqlobject plugin adds support for Kotlin SQL Objects,
    including Kotlin default methods, and default parameter values.
  - Support for collecting results into Map, and Guava's Multimap.
  - Configuration option to control how "untyped null" arguments are bound.
    Useful for some database vendors (e.g. Derby, Sybase) that expect a different
    SQL type constant for null values.
  - Support boolean[] return type from @SqlBatch methods
  - Bug fixes:
    - NullPointerException in Postgres plugin when binding null UUID
    - IllegalArgumentException with @SqlBatch when the batch is empty
    - NullPointerException when `null` is bound to an array column.

3.0.0-beta0
  - Redesigned for Java 8 - lambdas, streams, optionals, exception transparency
  - Support for java.time (JSR-310) types like LocalDate and OffsetDateTime
  - Better support for custom collection types, using Java 8 Collector
  - SQL array support -- finally!
  - BeanMapper and other reflection-based mappers now recognize snake_case
    column names, and match them up to Java properties
  - Plugin architecture that makes it easy to share configuration
  - Plugins to support types from 3rd party libraries: JodaTime, Guava,
    StringTemplate, Spring
  - Plugins to support specific database vendors: H2, Oracle, Postgres
  - Migration-friendly: Jdbi v2 and v3 will happily coexist within the same
    project, so you can migrate at your own pace.

            escaping of ':' (which is needed for postgres type casts)

2.10.0

    good enough.
  - fix more compiler warnings
  - add null checks for all object types on SqlStatement
  - move object null checks, that don't require boxing/unboxing

   Add new binding methods for SqlStatement
    - Integer, Boolean, Byte, Long, Short  Object
    - double, float, short primitive

    Deprecated OracleReturning.
    Added CallableStatement support :
      - new method handle.prepareCall
      - new Call class and CallableStatementMapper interface

    Fixes to colon prefix grammar to support empty string literals and
    escaped quotes.

    Allow configuring of externalized sql locating (ie, non-classpath)

1.2.2
    Add callback based transaction handling in order to cleanly support the various
    transactional contexts (CMT, BMT, Spring, Local) etc.

1.2.1
    Via the Spring DBIBean, IDBI#open(HandleCallback) now uses the transactionally bound handle
    if there is one.

1.2.0
    DBIException now extends RuntimeException. The 7 character change major release =)

    Added DBIUtils.closeHandleIfNecessary(Handle, IDBI) to allow for transparently managing
    transactions and connections in Spring whteher tx's are enabled or not.

1.1.2
    Handle#query(String, RowCallback): void no longer starts a transaction
    automagically

1.1.1

    during a major release cycle.

    Handle decorator functionality added to unstable feature set

    JavaBean mapped named parameter support

    Renamed Handle#preparedBatch to Handle#prepareBatch

    Queries return java.util.List instead of java.util.Collection

    Much more sophisticated auto-configuration

    Broke backwards compatibility on handle.query(String, Object) method behavior
        (this is reason why 1.1.0 version increment)
        (read the javadocs if you use this method)

    Removed method Handle#query(String, Object, Object)
        Could lea to confusion with changed behavior mentioned above

1.0.10
    Batch and PreparedBatch Support

    Removed an unused exception

    Better auto-detection of statement type (named, raw sql, etc)

1.0.8
    Spring integration tools

1.0.7
    Provide an interface for the DBI class in order to play nicer with proxies

1.0.6
    Prepared statement re-use was failing on Oracle, fixed.

1.0.5
    Fleshed out the execute(..) methods to take full array of arguments, like
    query.

    Added update(..): int which return number of rows affected

    Lots of internal refactoring

1.0.4
    Was swallowing an exception in one place for the (brief) 1.0.3 release.
    Definately upgrade if using 1.0.3

1.0.3
    Fixed a bug where quoted text could be interpreted as named tokens, bad me.

    Added HandleCallback methods to DBI to manage handle db resources etc for
    clients.

    Removed test dependency on Jakarta commons-io, which had been used, previously,
    for deleting the test database. Tests now depend only on derby and junit, still
    with no runtime dependencies (other than the JDBC driver for your database).

1.0.2
    Added facility for loading connection info from properties file
    for convenience. Totally optional, thankfully.

1.0.1
    Added overloaded argument signatures to callback-based queries

1.0
    Initial Release
