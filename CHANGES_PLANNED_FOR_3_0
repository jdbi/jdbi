This file describes the changes expected in some eventual 3.0 release.

* Make hashed prefix statement rewriter the default (Actually, figure out something that won't ever conflict with SQL!)
* Clean up exceptions, a lot
** Consider using Spring's exception mapping code to expose more useful exceptions
* Batter batch interface
** That the batch isn't a statement is a problem for the sql object api as you
   cannot apply sql statement customizers.
** It should use the same SQLStatement#internalExecute method for execution
   so that we can avoid duplicating that logic. Means rejiggering how stuff gets
   bound quite a bit.
* Clean up naming on sql object api elements
* Rework the sharing of StatementContext and Mappers to make ownership of these objects more clear
* Consider using Jackson for type mapping?
* Decide if ColumnNameMappingStrategy is the right abstraction?
* Revisit how SqlObject binding annotations work - lots of icky generics that don't seem to actually provide safety
* DefaultObjectBinder default constructor behaves differently due to lack of position information, so adding @Bind causes loss of functionality
* Revisit resource ownership -- we need a better model to keep track of all the various JDBC resources we use and ensure they are closed
* Reinstate maven-shade-plugin.
* Implement Types.findGenericParameter by hand, or copy TypeToken from Guava, and strip it down to only what we need.
* StatementContext: overload columnMapperFor, argumentFor, and/or collectorFor with variants that take Class<T> and GenericType<T>?
  * Not much to be gained by overloading argumentFor, other than to help out folks who don't know that Class IS_A Type.
* Coalesce MappingRegistry, ArgumentRegistry, and CollectorFactoryRegistry into a single type? They tend to get passed around together everywhere.
* Migrate sqlobject from Classmate ResolvedType to Guava TypeToken?
