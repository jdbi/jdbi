This file describes the changes expected in some eventual 3.0 release.

* Make hashed prefix statement rewriter the default (Actually, figure out something that won't ever conflict with SQL!)
* Clean up exceptions, a lot
** Consider using Spring's exception mapping code to expose more useful exceptions
* Batter batch interface
** That the batch isn't a statement is a problem for the sql object api as you
   cannot apply sql statement customizers.
** It should use the same SQLStatement#internalExecute method for execution
   so that we can avoid duplicating that logic. Means rejiggering how stuff gets
   bound quite a bit.
* Clean up naming on sql object api elements
* Use Type instead of Class to support more robust generics in mappers.
* Rework the sharing of StatementContext and Mappers to make ownership of these objects more clear
* Consider using Jackson for type mapping?
* Consider CallbackFailedException wrapping policy (see #198)
