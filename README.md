[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdbi/jdbi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdbi/jdbi)

The Jdbi library provides convenient, idiomatic access to relational databases
in Java.

Jdbi is built on top of JDBC. If your database has a JDBC driver, you can use
Jdbi with it.

## Prerequisites

Jdbi 3 requires Java 8.

We've done some light testing with Java 9, and would appreciate reports of any problems!

## Builds

Jdbi is built with Maven:

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

The tests use real Postgres, H2, and Oracle databases.

For Postgres and H2, you do not need to install anything--the tests will spin up
temporary database servers as needed.

By default, the build skips over `jdbi3-oracle12`. Oracle keeps their JDBC
drivers in a password-protected Maven repository, so some additional setup is
required before `jdbi3-oracle12` can build.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jdbi/jdbi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
contains instructions to help set up your environment to build `jdbi3-oracle12`.
