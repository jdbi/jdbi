= Jdbi and Handles

A *Jdbi* object is the main entry point into the library.
It is roughly analogous to a
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html[javax.sql.DataSource]
combined with configuration for the various *jdbi* APIs.

A configured DBI is threadsafe and does not own any database resources.
An application should configure a single or small number of shared
DBI instances.  In a more limited scope (such as a HTTP request, or event callback), you then
request a *Handle* object from your *DBI*.  This *Handle* represents an active database
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html[java.sql.Connection]
and inheirts *Jdbi*'s configuration at the time of creation.

----
Jdbi userDatabase = Jdbi.create("jdbc:postgresql://localhost");
final Optional<MyUser> foundUser = userDatabase.withHandle(h ->
    h.createQuery("SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=:id")
        .bind("id", 3)
        .map(MyUser.class)
        .findFirst()
);

*Handle* provides a fluent <<statements#,Statement>> API that can map
<<arguments#,arguments>> and <<results#,result sets>>
to and from regular Java objects.
You may register mappings for arguments
<<arguments#argument-factory,manually>> or use 
<<arguments#bean-argument,Java Bean conventions>>.

For result sets you can map
<<results#row-mapper,one row at a time>>,
<<results#column-mapper,by the type of each column>>, as
<<results#bean-mapper,beans>>, or invoking
<<results#constructor-mapper,annotated constructors>>.
