= Arguments and Binding

Most non-trivial queries require binding arguments from Java land
to the statement.  In addition to binding by index (which is zero-based
in *jdbi*, unlike JDBC's bizarre one-indexing scheme), named parameters
are supported out of the box.

All primitive and many core Java types come with predefined bindings.

include::ArgumentsTest.java[tags=bindValue]
-------------------------------------------

You also have a couple of options to deal with custom types.
The *Argument* class wraps a single value into a binding.

-------------------------------------------
include::ArgumentsTest.java[tags=uuidArgument]
-------------------------------------------

<1> Since Argument usually directly calls into JDBC directly,
it is given the *one-based index* when it is applied.

Here we use an *Argument* to directly bind a UUID.  In this
particular case, the most obvious approach is to send the UUID
to the database as a String.  If your JDBC driver supports custom
types directly or efficient binary transfers, you can leverage them
easily here.

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::ArgumentsTest.java[tags=uuidArgumentFactory]
-------------------------------------------

You can also register *ArgumentFactory* instances which can inspect
the type of bindings and determine if they understand how to convert
the type to Arguments.
