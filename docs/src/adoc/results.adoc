= Results

After executing a database query, you need to interpret the results.
JDBC provides the *ResultSet* class which can do simple mapping to
Java primitives and built in classes, but the API is often cumbersome
to use.  *jdbi* provides configurable mapping, including
the ability to register custom mappers for rows and columns.

A *RowMapper* converts a row of a *ResultSet* into a result object.

A *ColumnMapper* converts a single column's value into a Java object.
It can be used as a *RowMapper* if there is only one column present,
or it can be used to build more complex *RowMapper*s.

The mapper is selected based on the declared result type of your query.

*jdbi* iterates over the rows in the ResultSet and presents the mapped results
to you in a container such as a *List*, *Stream*, *Optional*, or *Iterator*.

== Row Mapper

The row mapper is called once for every row as *jdbi* iterates
through the result set.

Row mappers are either configured on a fluent query, or
can be registered to handle a type:

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::ResultsTest.java[tags=rowMapper]
-------------------------------------------

This *RowMapper* is equivalent to the lambda mapper above but more explicit.
We also introduce the *Query.list()* method which collects all rows into a
*List<T>* object.

-------------------------------------------
include::ResultsTest.java[tags=rowMapperFactory]
-------------------------------------------

The Factory is allowed to consider whether it can handle any given *Type*
and provides the above RowMapper to do the actual work.

*Stream* integration allows you to use a RowMapper to adapt a ResultSet into
the new Java 8 Streams framework.  As long as your database supports streaming
results (for example, PostgreSQL will do it as long as you are in a transaction
and set a fetch size), the stream will lazily fetch rows from the database as
necessary.

== Constructor Mapper

*jdbi* provides a simple constructor mapper which uses reflection to assign
columns to constructor parameters by name.  Unfortunately parameter names
are not enabled by default and require a compiler option, but once you
have that enabled the result is quite concise:

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::ResultsTest.java[tags=constructorMapper]
-------------------------------------------

The parameter names "id", "name" match the database column names
and as such no custom mapper code is required at all.

== Column Mapper

Sometimes you only wish to fetch a single value, or need
to build a larger object out of multiple individually mappable
elements.  A column mapper works on a single column instead of
by row:

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::ResultsTest.java[tags=columnMapper]
-------------------------------------------

Notice how the ConstructorMapper, which usually would not know
what to do with a custom *UserName* object, now automatically
uses the column mapper to fill in the constructor parameter.

== Bean Mapper

We also provide basic support for beans:

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::ResultsTest.java[tags=beanMapper]
-------------------------------------------

== Annotations

You can register mappers declaratively on SqlObjects using e.g.
`@RegisterRowMapper`, `@RegisterColumnMapper`, `@RegisterConstructorMapper`,
and so on.



= ResultBearing

The *ResultBearing* interface determines how the statement results
are gathered and returned to you.  The methods are designed to
interact well with the new Java 8 *@FunctionalInterface*s and
*Stream* library.  Given a type T that can be mapped by the registered
mappers,

== Find a Single Result

*ResultBearing#findOnly* returns the only row in the result set.  If zero
or multiple rows are encountered, it will throw *IllegalStateException*.

*#findFirst* returns an *Optional<T>* with the first row, if any.

== Stream

*#stream* returns a *Stream<T>*.  You should then process the stream and
produce a result.  This stream must be closed to release any database
resources held, so we recommend using a *try-with-resources* block to
ensure that no resources are leaked.

*#withStream* and *#useStream* handle closing the stream for you.  You
provide a *StreamCallback* that produces a result or a *StreamConsumer*
that produces no result, respectively.

== Collections

*#list* emits a *List<T>*.  This necessarily buffers all results in memory.

*#collect* takes a *Collector<T, ? , R>* that builds a resulting collection
*R<T>*.  The *java.util.stream.Collectors* class has a number of interesting
*Collector*s to start with.

== Reduction

*#reduce* provides a simplified *Stream#reduce*.  Given an identity
starting value and a *BiFunction<U, T, U>* it will repeatedly combine
*U*s until only a single remains, and then return that.
