= jdbi3 documentation

*jdbi* is a thin wrapper around the Java database
API, JDBC.  It provides helpful abstractions around
accessing your database tables in a way that respects
the relational model.

Unlike an ORM, *jdbi* does not pretend to seamlessly
convert your Java object model into the relational
model -- instead, it provides easy mapping between
SQL _you_ write and simple tabular data structures.

*jdbi3* is an update which sports a cleaned up API,
a stronger resource ownership model, and leverages
the power of the new Java 8 APIs.

WARNING: *jdbi3* is currently under active development.
http://www.jdbi.org[jdbi2] is still the stable release.
*jdbi3* should generously be considered alpha quality.
We love feedback and early testing, but be prepared to
find a few bugs!
