<h2>Statements and Queries</h2>
<p>
    Query and statement processing goes through a number of stages. When a statement is first created it is effectively
    a builder object which you use to configure what you want it to do. You can add customizers, result mappers, define
    properties on its statement context, bind arguments, and so on. It stays pretty much the same, modulo what
    you set, until the statement is executed. When the statement is executed the fun starts.
</p>
<p>
    The first thing the statement does is lookup the actual SQL to use from the <code>StatementLocator</code>. This
    class receives the string used to create the statement and returns another String, possibly the same. The
    default implementation returns the same string if it lokos like SQL, otherwise looks for it on the classpath,
    you can see the javadocs for
    <code><a href="../api-2.0/org/skife/jdbi/v2/ClasspathStatementLocator.html">ClasspathStatementLocator</a></code>
    for the exact details. You can plug your own in on the DBI if you want different lookup rules. The
    <code><a href="../api-2.0/org/skife/jdbi/v2/unstable/stringtemplate/StringTemplateStatementLocator.html">
        StringTemplateStatementLocator
    </a></code> is another bundled statement locator which supports some dynamic sql generation, for example.
</p>
<p>
    After the bas SQL string has been located it is passed to a <code>StatementRewriter</code>. The rewriter
    is used to do final manipulation. The default one, for instance, converts <code>:foo</code> tokens into
    <code>?</code> to support named parameters. See
    <code><a href="../api-2.0/org/skife/jdbi/v2/ColonPrefixNamedParamStatementRewriter.html">ColonPrefixNamedParamStatementRewriter</a></code>
    for more information.
</p>
<p>
    Next, the rewritten SQL is passed to a <code>StatementBuilder</code> which converts the sql to a JDBC
    <code>PreparedStatement</code>. The default implementation creates a new prepared statement every time, but
    there is also an incuded implementation which will cache prepared statements on a given handle.
</p>
<p>
    The last step before execution is to invoke any statement customizers which have been applied to the statement.
    This includes things like the <code>OracleReturning</code> functionality, as well as custom ones.
</p>
<p>
    Post execution, query customizers are run again (post-execution callback).
</p>
<p>
    After customizers run, a query has its result set passed through the specified mapper, either eagerly in the case of
    <code>list()</code> or lazily in the case of <code>iterate()</code>, whereas a DML statement just returns the
    rows modfied.
