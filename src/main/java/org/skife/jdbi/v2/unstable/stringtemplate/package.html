    A statement locator which makes use of <a href="http://stringtemplate.org">StringTemplate 3.0</a>
    for locating templates. Specifically, if a statement doesn't look like SQL based on its first token (ie, it starts
    lexing it as sql, and if it fails, it treats it as a name), it splits the name into pieces on colons. The first token
    is the string template group file, the second is the template name. Consider the following <code>tests.stg</code>,
    which is adapted from the one in the unit tests, and is loaded via the <code>ClasspathStatementLocator</code>:
</p>
<pre>
group tests;

insert_one() ::= "insert into something (id, name) values (7, 'Martin')"

parameterized_insert(table, column_one, column_two) ::=&lt;&lt;
    insert into $table$ ($column_one$, $column_two$) values (:column_one, :column_two)
&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    This defines two templates, the first has no parameters and is used like this:
</p>
<pre>
    public void testSimpleTemplate() throws Exception
    {
        final Handle h = openHandle();
        final int count = h.insert("tests:insert_one");
        assertEquals(1, count);
    }
</pre>
<p>
    This looks for a template group named "tests" and a template in that group named "insert_one". Template
    groups are located by providing a <code>StringTenmplateGroupLoader</code> to the statement locator, which
    is responsible for loading template groups. The included one looks on the class path, in this case for a
    file named "tests.stg" which would be relative to the roots passd in the the <code>ClasspathGroupLoader</code>'s
    constructor, or the root of the classpath if none were.
</p>
<p>
    Template parameters are bound from values in the <code>StatementContext</code>, such as the following:
</p>
<pre>
    public void testParameterizedInsert() throws Exception
    {
        final Handle h = openHandle();
        final int count = h.createStatement("tests:parameterized_insert")
                .define("table", "something")
                .define("column_one", "id")
                .define("column_two", "name")
                .bind("column_one", 7)
                .bind("column_two", "Rebecca")
                .execute();
        assertEquals(1, count);
    }
</pre>
<p>
    This one uses the parameters defined in the <code>define(..)</code> calls, which populate the
    values onto the <code>StatementContext</code> for the statement.
</p>
