<p>
The <code>extension</code> classes allow you to extend <code>Jdbi</code>'s
functionality by declaring interface types that may attach to <code>Handle</code>
instances.  An attached extension creates an instance of the interface that
wraps method invocations in an extension context.  The context has a
configuration and remembers the currently executing extension method.

An ExtensionFactory instance provides the actual extension instances and
implements the behavior of the extension.
